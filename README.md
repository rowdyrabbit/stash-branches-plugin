stash-branches-plugin
=====================

View all your branches on one page.

This add-on displays a list of all the remote branches in your repository and allows you to compare them to any other branch.

It was inspired by Github's 'Branch List' feature and displays how many commits ahead and behind each branch is.

If a branch only has commits ahead of the selected comparison branch, it can be merged safely without conflicts.

If a branch has no commits ahead of the selected comparison branch, it has already been merged and may be a candidate for deletion.
